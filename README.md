## Introduction

This project uses the Superstore dataset, a structured retail dataset commonly used in analytics and business intelligence learning. It simulates an e-commerce business and contains detailed information across three tables:
* Orders – transaction-level sales data including order ID, product details, sales amount, profit, discount, customer segment, and shipping information.
* Returns – a reference table tracking whether specific orders were returned.
* People – regional assignment data showing which person manages each region.
  
Together, these tables support a wide range of analytical tasks such as sales performance tracking, profitability analysis, product insights, customer segmentation, and return behavior.

## Business Understanding

The business scenario behind this dataset represents a growing retail superstore looking to improve its overall performance. The company wants to understand:
* Which products and categories contribute most to revenue
* How sales fluctuate across months, quarters, and years
* Which customer segments drive the most profit
* Which regions underperform and require strategic attention
* How return rates impact profitability
* How shipping methods influence customer experience and sales timelines

By developing a data-driven Power BI dashboard, the business aims to gain clearer visibility into operations, optimize inventory decisions, improve regional management, and enhance marketing strategies.
